## US_GDP Time Series Forecasting
- the dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapatsa/modelled-time-series/code)
- this was my first project on time series forecasting using SARIMA/ARIMA models.
- I learnt about the AR (autoregressive), MA (moving average) models
- I learnt about seasonality, white noise, stationary process
- I reviewed the LSTM model and its peculiarities
